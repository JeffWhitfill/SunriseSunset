This project app takes an input location and reveals its longitude and latitude on the Geocode file, the times for sunrise and sunset at that location and then shares some weather information at that location (i.e. temperature, humidity and wind speed).
There is a navigation bar which will direct you to each of these pages.
This application can prove to be ideal in determining the viablity of any outdoor activities that could be impacted by the presence of sunlight or weather conditions.

In the sunrise-sunset-project directory, please run:

npm install

then npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
